## 🧪 Research Interests

I'm working on photonic tests of quantum foundations and generalized probabilistic theories, including:

- **Three-Slit GPT Experiment**: Testing higher-order interference with a Tsunami 790 single-photon source.
- **Quantum Axioms via Photonic Qubits**: Exploring epistemic toy models and tomography.

## 📝 Talks & Publications

- *“Testing Higher-Order Interference in a GPT Framework”* – In prep
- IQC Seminar: *Single-Photon GPTs*
- Poster: Quantum Foundations 2025

## 🎓 Teaching & Mentoring

- Mentored undergrads and new grad students at IQC
- Gave outreach talks to high schools across Ontario
