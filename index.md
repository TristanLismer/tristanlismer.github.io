title: "Tristan Lismer | Quantum Optics & SQL Portfolio"
---

# Hi, I'm Tristan 👋
I'm a PhD candidate at the Institute for Quantum Computing working on photonic tests of quantum foundations and generalized probabilistic theories. I'm also an SQL-savvy scientist passionate about data, lasers, and precision metrology.

## 🧠 About Me

I'm currently researching foundational experiments using single-photon sources and three-slit interferometers. My goal is to bridge theoretical ideas like higher-order interference with real-world optical setups.

Outside the lab, I love endurance sports and mentoring new physicists.

## 📚 Research Highlights

- **Three-Slit GPT Experiment**  
  Exploring higher-order interference using single-photon sources and slits with adjustable phases.

- **Quantum Axioms with Photonic Qubits**  
  Experimental tests of Spekkens' epistemic toy model and tomographic completeness.

- **Optomechanics & Quantum Sensing**  
  LC-circuit coupling and cold atom effects on atomic clock frequency shifts.

## 💾 SQL & Data Projects

- **Photon Data Reduction in SQL**  
  Efficiently indexed coincidence counting for SPDC events in multi-slit setups.

- **SQL-Based Interference Analysis**  
  Used SQL views to analyze phase-varying datasets across slit combinations.

```sql
-- Sample SQL query used for analyzing slit phase data
SELECT phase1, phase2, phase3,
       AVG(intensity) AS avg_intensity
FROM slit_interference_data
GROUP BY phase1, phase2, phase3;
```
